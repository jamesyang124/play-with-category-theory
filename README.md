# Thinking Category Theory

**Category theory** is a concept in terms of a collection of **objects** and **arrows**. It defines a category which is very useful for the type system in functional programming.

A category is an **algebraic structure** that comprises **objects** that are linked by **arrows**. 

Two categories are the same if they have:

1. Same collection of objects. 
2. Same collection of arrows
3. same associative method of composing any pair of arrows.

This book is the collection of side notes for the category theory with the example from `Haskell`. It will cover some critical `Haskell` terms to help us understanding the other concepts of functional programming in advance.

Though the most of code will be present in `Haskell` way, but it will try to cover `Scala` version of implementation which is what we aim for.
