# Thinking Category Theory

This book is a collection of side notes for the category theory with the example from `Haskell`. It will cover critical `Haskell` terms to help us understanding the other concepts of functional programming in advance.

Most of code snippets will be in `Haskell` way, but we will try to cover `Scala` version of the implementations which is what we mainly aim for.

Category theory is a concept in terms of a collection of **objects** and **arrows**. It defines a category which is very useful for the type system in functional programming.

A category is an **algebraic structure** that comprises **objects** that are linked by **arrows**. 

Two categories are the same if they have:

1. Same collection of objects. 
2. Same collection of arrows.
3. Same associative method of composing any pair of arrows.

Throughout the rest of this book, We are preferable to use **morphism** for the same meaning as the term **arrows**.

With above introduction, let's get started to its definition in next chapter.
