# Thinking Category Theory

**Category theory** is a concept in terms of a collection of **objects** and **morphisms**. It defines a category system which is very useful for the type system in functional programming.

Two categories are the same if they have the **same collection of objects, the same collection of arrows, and the same associative method of composing any pair of arrows**.

This book is about the learning side notes of the category theory with `Haskell` .


The code example will covered by `Haskell` or `Scala` but mainly on `Scala`.
