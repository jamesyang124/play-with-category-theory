# Thinking Category Theory

This book is the collection of side notes for the category theory with the example from `Haskell`. It will cover critical `Haskell` terms to help us understanding the other concepts of functional programming in advance.

Most of code snippets will be in `Haskell` way, but we will try to cover `Scala` version of the implementations which is what we mainly aim for.
