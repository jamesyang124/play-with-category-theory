# Thinking Category Theory

**Category theory** is a concept in terms of a collection of **objects** and **arrows**. It defines a category system which is very useful for the type system in functional programming.

A category is an **algebraic structure** that comprises "objects" that are linked by "arrows". 

Two categories are the same if they have the same collection of objects, the same collection of arrows, and the same associative method of composing any pair of arrows.

This book is about any side notes of the category theory with the example from `Haskell`. It will cover some critical `Haskell` terms to help us understanding functional programming in advance.

The code example will be either from `Haskell` or `Scala`.
