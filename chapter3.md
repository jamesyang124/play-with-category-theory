# Applicative Functor


#### Part I - Application in functors

We have know about the application `$` operator and functor `fmap`, as useful as it is, `fmap` isn't much help if we want to apply a function of two arguments to functorial values. 

How could we sum `Just 2` and `Just 3`? The brute force approach would be extracting the values from the `Maybe` wrapper. That, however, would mean having to do tedious checks for `Nothing`. Even worse: in a different `Functor` extracting the value might not even be an option (just think about `IO`).

We could use `fmap` to partially apply `+` to the first argument:

```haskell
Prelude> :t (+) <$> Just 2
-- a partial applied function wrapped in Maybe
(+) <$> Just 2 :: Num a => Maybe (a -> a)
```

But now we are stuck: **we have a function and a value both wrapped in `Maybe`, and no way of applying one to the other**.

What we would like to have is an operator with a type akin to `f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b` to apply functions in the context of a functor - `<*>`:

```haskell
(+) <$> Just 2 <*> Just 3
Just 5

Prelude> :t (<*>)
(<*>) :: Applicative f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

`<*>` is one of the methods of `Applicative`, the type class of applicative functors - functors that **support function application within their contexts**. 

Ordianry `Functors` help us related two categories' types, but have limit ability to related function applications in two different categories. We need to define applicative functors for higher abstraction.

#### Part II - Why we need applicative functor?

Take `*` multiplier as an example, it takes two inputs over a functor, when we do `fmap (*) (Just 3)` it turns out `Just(* 3)` partial applied function. What if we want to map `Just(* 3)` functor over `Just(5)` to get the result? 

```haskell
let a = fmap (*) [1,2,3,4]  
:t a 
#a :: Num a => [a -> a]
```

But we **can't map a function that's inside a functor over another functor** with what `fmap` defined for us.

We could pattern-match against the `Just` constructor to get the function out of it and then map it over `Just 5`, but we're looking for a more general and abstract way of doing that, which works across functors.

To refine above definition:

As useful as it is, `fmap` isn't much help if we want to apply a function of two or more arguments to functorial values.

If we start by using `fmap` then we will get a partial applied function inside that `Functor` type:

```haskell
(+) <$> Just 2
# (+) <$> Just 2 :: Num a => Maybe (a -> a)
# result a f(b -> c) 
```

So we need a morphism which define `f(a -> b) -> f(a) -> f(b)`:

```haskell
(<*>) :: Applicative f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

By this menas, we can curry our result until all input are curried, then final result delivered. To wrap function into a `Functor`, there has a `pure` morphism which wrap it:

```haskell
class (Functor f) => Applicative f where
    pure  :: a -> f a
    (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

Then we left those applicative functor laws:

```haskell
# -- Identity
pure id <*> v = v

# -- Homomorphism
pure f <*> pure x = pure (f x)               

# -- Interchange
u <*> pure y = pure ($ y) <*> u

# -- Composition
pure (.) <*> u <*> v <*> w = u <*> (v <*> w) 

# -- fmap
fmap f x = pure f <*> x                      
```

`($ y)` is the function that supplies (**return**) `y` as argument to another function.

#### Homomorphism 

A function `f :: a -> b` between two monoids `a` and `b` is called a monoid homomorphism if it preserves the monoid structure, so that: 

```haskell
f mempty          = mempty
f (x `mappend` y) = f x `mappend` f y
```

The functor only address a single input function `(f: a -> b)`. But what if we need a multi-parameters function inside a functor and map over to final output in a general way?

To address above **multi-paramters** issue and provide a general definition for **mapping a functor which have a function over another functor**, **Applicative** type class defined as follow:

<br>
#### Definition

```haskell
class (Functor f) => Applicative f where  
    pure :: a -> f a  
    (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b  
```

Beyond `<*>`, the class has a second method, `pure`, which brings arbitrary values(maybe a function) into the functor. 

It starts the definition of the `Applicative` class and **it also introduces a class constraint `(Fucntor f)`**. 

It says that if we want to make a type constructor part of the `Applicative` typeclass, **it has to be in `Functor` first**. That's why if we know that if a type constructor is part of the `Applicative` typeclass, it's also in `Functor`, so we can use `fmap` on it.

A better way of thinking about `pure` would be to say that it takes a value and puts it in some sort of default (or `pure`) context â€” a minimal context that still yields that value. 

Now we can map a normal function `g: a -> b` over a functor which have that function inside it:

```haskell
# M is the context
pure g == M g
```

Let's check `Maybe`'s applicative implementation, remember we have `fmap` since `Maybe` is aslo a functor:

```haskell
instance Applicative Maybe where  
    pure = Just  
    Nothing <*> _ = Nothing  
    (Just f) <*> something = fmap f something  
```

The `(Just f) <*> something = fmap f something` obey the definition as it takes a functor which have a function and another functor in left side of `=`, then map them over to another functor at the right side of `=`.

We observe that `(Just f)` could be rewritten as `pure f`, then above `applicative` definition can supply a law as:

```haskell
pure f <*> something = fmap f something
```

It could be translated as: 

> when we take a function `f` with another functor `something` as input for `<*>`, then the output is equivalent to `fmap f something`.

Now, if `f` is a multi-paramter function, we could gracefully yield the result from `pure f <*> x <*> y ...` because `<*>` is **left associative**.

In `haskell` it also export a function `<$>` to reduce redundant code:

```haskell
(<$>) :: (Functor f) => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
# f <$> x = pure f <*> x = fmap f something
f <$> x = fmap f something

(++) <$> Just "johntra" <*> Just "volta"
```

Now we basically solve multi-paramter function issue. We don't have to handly do the pattern match over and over again to unboxing the context and apply with the value.

`Control.Applicative` defines a function that's called `liftA2`. It's defined like this:

```haskell
liftA2 :: (Applicative f) => (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c  
liftA2 f a b = f <$> a <*> b 
```

Applicative functors are more powerful than just ordinary functors. With ordinary functors, we can just map functions over **one functor**. But with applicative functors, **we can apply a function between several functors**.

#### Applicative functor laws

```haskell
pure id <*> v = v                            -- Identity
pure f <*> pure x = pure (f x)               -- Homomorphism

-- ($ y) u == (u $ y) apply u to function y in low precedence.
u <*> pure y = pure ($ y) <*> u              -- Interchange
pure (.) <*> u <*> v <*> w = u <*> (v <*> w) -- Composition
```
