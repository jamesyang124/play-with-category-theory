## What is Category?

**Category theory** is a concept in terms of a collection of objects and morphisms.

A category should have three basic components:

1. **objects** 
2. **morphisms** 
3. **morphism composition**


#### Morphisms

It can be described as a function, map, arrow. 

#### Morphsim composition


Morphisms must be composable such as a composition `f . g` is composed from morphism `f` and `g`. This is also a **binary operation** of the **prodcut** in Category theory. 

The composition intends to **closed** the relationship from `f -> g` as `f . g` which apply from **right to left**.

We can denote that composition as:

`(f.g)(x) == f(g(x))`

It can also be visualized as:

If a category holds above three components, then it should have the **category laws** as below:

1. The composition of morphisms is associative.
2.
