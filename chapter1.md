**Category theory** is a concept in terms of a collection of objects and morphisms.

To form a category, it should have two basic properties which are **objects** and **morphisms**. 

To define a collection as a category, besides above mentioned properties, the morphisms must be composable such as a composition `f . g` is compose from morphism `f` and `g`. This is called a **binary operation**. The composition property intends to **closed** the relationship from `f -> g` as `f . g` which is applied from **right to left**.

It can be visualize as follow image:
