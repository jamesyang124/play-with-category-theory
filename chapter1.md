## What is Category?

**Category theory** is a concept in terms of a collection of objects and morphisms.

To form a category, it should have two basic properties which are **objects** and **morphisms**. 

To define a collection as a category, the morphisms must have the composable property to form a composition `f . g` from morphism `f` and morphism `g`. This is called a **binary operation**. The property intends to **closed** the relationship from `f -> g` as `f . g`.

It can be visualize as follow image:
